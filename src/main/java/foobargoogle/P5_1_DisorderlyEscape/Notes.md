Obviously this is a pure math problem. And I (and probably most of the people) was not aware of it before. 
So the first question is how to get start?

Hint: calculate the first few numbers in the sequence, and search them in [OEIS](https://oeis.org/).

For example, for n*n grid with 2 states/colors, the first few numbers in the sequence are `1, 2, 7`:

* Grid 0*0 has 0 configurations/orbits
* Grid 1*1 has 2 configurations/orbits (0 and 1 / white and black)
* Grid 2*2 has 7 configurations/orbits as given by the problem

Searching `1, 2, 7 "matrices"` in OEIS gives https://oeis.org/search?q=1%2C+2%2C+7+%22matrices%22&sort=&language=&go=Search .
Although the one we are looking for (A002724) is not the first result, but clearly it indicates the problem
is something related to matrix and permutation. It is a good direction to further dig in.

It turns out this is about some famous theories in group theory, specifically Burnside's lemma, and PÃ³lya enumeration theorem.
